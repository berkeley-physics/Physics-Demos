# Physics-Demos
This repository is intended to serve as a collection of notebooks that aims to help physics students by providing interactive demos and visualizations.

Most notebooks will be written in a way that doesn't require any programming experience from the user, though they are encouraged to read through the code if they want to start learning some Python!
